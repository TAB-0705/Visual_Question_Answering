# 🧠 Visual Question Answering (VQA) System

This project is an implementation of a **Visual Question Answering (VQA)** system — a deep learning model that can understand an image and answer natural language questions about its contents.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This VQA model combines **computer vision** and **natural language processing** to:
- Extract visual features from images using CNNs
- Understand questions using LSTM/BERT
- Fuse both modalities to generate answers

Supports datasets like:
- [CLEVR](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jcjohns/clevr/)

---

## 🧰 Features

- Visual question answering from images
- Supports custom datasets
- Attention mechanism (optional)
- Trainable on GPU (PyTorch / TensorFlow)
- Modular and extensible codebase
